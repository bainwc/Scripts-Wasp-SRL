# Scripts-Wasp-SRL

Glory Charger:

Currently only supports Wildy Sword 4 and an ornate pool in house, near portal. Will run until out of glories or out of house tabs.  
Wider support coming, was just excited to have a first functional script and wanted to share :D

1. Have Wildy Sword 4 and a glory equipped.
2. Have ornate pool next to portal. 
3. Have house tabs anywhere at the bottom of the inventory.
4. Have uncharged glories filling remaining inventory. 
5. Have uncharged glories and house tabs visible at the top of the bank.

To do:
Add annakarl tele support, add obelisk support.
